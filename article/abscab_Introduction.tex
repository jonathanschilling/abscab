Usually,
the magnetic field is denoted by $\mathbf{H}$ and
the magnetic flux density $\mathbf{B}$ is then given by $\mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mu_\mathrm{r} \mathbf{H}$,
where $\mu_0$ is the vacuum magnetic permeability
and $\mu_r$ is the relative permeability, taking material properties into account.
In the field of plasma physics generally and in this work in particular,
these two terms are frequently used synonymously
due to the vanishing magnetic susceptibility $|\chi| \ll 1$ of the plasma,
leading to $\mu_r = 1+\chi \approx 1$.
Then, magnetic field and magnetic flux density only differ by a factor of $\mu_0$.
