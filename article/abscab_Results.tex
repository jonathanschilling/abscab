\subsection{Testing the Asymptotic Behaviour}

The asymptotic behaviour of an implementation of above formulas for the magnetic vector potential
and magnetic field needs to be tested before using that implementation in daily routine work.
A set of critical test points used to check this is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:circularLoop_criticalPoints}
for the case of the circular wire loop.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

 \caption{Test points in the $R$-$Z$-plane for a circular wire loop (black dot).
          The axes are labelled in normalized cylindrical coordinates ($\rho' = \rho / a$, $z' = z / a$; $a$ is the radius of the wire loop).
          Green dashed lines indicate values of $\rho'$ and $z'$ which are well handled by a naive implementation.
          Green dots denote points at which a naive implementation yields satisfactory results.
          Red dashed lines indicate values of $\rho'$ and $z'$ which induce the requirement for robust asymptotic behaviour.
          Red dots denote points at which a naive implementation usually fails.
          The grey shaded area in the background indicates the region in which the reference implementation yields accurate results.
          Note that the problem is symmetric in $z$ direction, even though only the positive-$z$ quadrant is considered here.}

Reference outputs have been computed using the \texttt{mpmath} Python package~\cite{mpmath}.
The reference implementation was tested at a subset of the test points against Mathematica~\cite{Mathematica}.
The results are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ref_cylWireLoop}.

It turns out that most of these problems have been considered in Ref.~\cite{walstrom_2017} already.
